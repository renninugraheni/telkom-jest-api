# Telkom-jest-api
Telkom-jest-api is a project to answer the post-test SQAE. I hope this becomes a consideration to be accepted as a SQAE at Telkom.
# Requirements
- Node version 8 or higher
- Jest

This project works fine with NPM. To keep things simple we use yarn in this guide, but feel free to replace this with NPM if that is what you are using.

# Quick Start
1.  Download the latest stable release here or clone the git repo.

2. Then:

Copy the files to your project into a directory.

3. Install the dependencies (npm install).
# How to run the test

# Configurations
To configure your tests, checkout the jest.config.js file in your test directory.
